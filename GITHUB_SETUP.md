## üìã Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New Repository" (green button)
3. Name it: `gaza-relief`
4. Description: "Secure humanitarian aid platform for Gaza donations"
5. Keep it **Public** (so others can contribute)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Copy Your Repository URL
GitHub will show you a URL like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gaza-relief.git
```
Copy this URL.

### Step 3: Initialize Git (in your project)
```bash
# Check if git is already initialized
git status

# If not initialized, run:
git init
```

### Step 4: Add Files and Commit
```bash
# Add all files
git add .

# Check what will be committed
git status

# Make your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Gaza Relief platform with military-grade security

Allah S.W.T knows best, and we can only guess - Built for Gaza humanitarian aid"
```

### Step 5: Connect to GitHub
```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gaza-relief.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v
```

### Step 6: Push to GitHub
```bash
# Set main branch and push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Security Note:
Your repository will be public, but contains no sensitive data:
